+	help
+	 Select 833 Hz as an alternative to 1000 Hz. This choice offers a balance between
+	 latency and performance, providing a slightly lower interrupt frequency that
+	 reduces interrupt overhead and improves system stability. It maintains satisfactory
+	 interactive responsiveness and is suitable for various applications where a
+	 lower interrupt frequency is desired without sacrificing overall system
+	 performance. Examples include audio workstations or video editing systems that
+	 require precise timing while minimizing system overhead.

 	 1000 Hz is the preferred choice for desktop systems and other
 	 systems requiring fast interactive responses to events.
 
+	config HZ_1666
+		bool "1666 Hz"
+	help
+	 Select 1666 Hz for systems with low latency requirements. This choice prioritizes
+	 low latency over overall throughput and performance. It offers a snappier feel
+	 in response to interactive processes and is suitable for real-time systems,
+	 latency-sensitive workloads, and applications that demand quick response times,
+	 such as real-time audio or video processing. Examples include audio production
+	 systems, video streaming platforms, or real-time control systems. However, it
+	 may result in increased power consumption and slightly reduced overall system
+	 throughput.
+
+	config HZ_2000
+		bool "2000 Hz"
+	help
+	 Select 2000 Hz for demanding scenarios that require extremely fast timer interrupt
+	 responses. This choice offers exceptional interactive responsiveness and is ideal
+	 for ultra-low latency and real-time applications where precise timing is crucial,
+	 such as high-frequency trading or control systems. Examples include financial
+	 trading platforms or robotics control systems. However, it significantly increases
+	 interrupt overhead, power consumption, system load, and may negatively impact overall
+	 system stability.
