 choice
-	prompt "Timer frequency"

 	default HZ_250
 	help
-	 Allows the configuration of the timer frequency. It is customary
-	 to have the timer interrupt run at 1000 Hz but 100 Hz may be more
-	 beneficial for servers and NUMA systems that do not need to have
-	 a fast response for user interaction and that may experience bus
-	 contention and cacheline bounces as a result of timer interrupts.
-	 Note that the timer interrupt occurs on each processor in an SMP
-	 environment leading to NR_CPUS * HZ number of timer interrupts
-	 per second.
-
+	 Select the desired timer frequency. The timer interrupt frequency determines
+	 how often the system generates interrupts to handle time-related tasks.
+	 Different frequencies offer trade-offs between interactive responsiveness,
+	 system stability, power consumption, and overall system performance.
 
 	config HZ_100
-		bool "100 HZ"
+		bool "100 Hz"
 	help
-	  100 Hz is a typical choice for servers, SMP and NUMA systems
-	  with lots of processors that may show reduced performance if
-	  too many timer interrupts are occurring.
+	  Select 100 Hz for servers, symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), and non-uniform
+	  memory access (NUMA) systems with multiple processors. This choice reduces
+	  interrupt overhead and enhances overall system stability. It is particularly
+	  suitable for scenarios where quick user interaction is not crucial, such as
+	  servers handling heavy workloads without immediate user feedback. It provides
+	  a balanced performance level for background tasks and workloads that do not
+	  require real-time responsiveness.
 
 	config HZ_250
-		bool "250 HZ"
+		bool "250 Hz"
 	help
-	 250 Hz is a good compromise choice allowing server performance
-	 while also showing good interactive responsiveness even
-	 on SMP and NUMA systems. If you are going to be using NTSC video
-	 or multimedia, selected 300Hz instead.
+	 Select 250 Hz as a balanced option suitable for a wide range of scenarios.
+	 It provides a compromise between interrupt frequency, server performance,
+	 and interactive responsiveness. This choice ensures smooth execution of
+	 server workloads while maintaining satisfactory interactive response times.
+	 It is suitable for general-purpose computing scenarios where a balance
+	 between system performance and interactivity is required. Examples include
+	 web servers, database servers, and cloud infrastructure.
 
 	config HZ_300
-		bool "300 HZ"
+		bool "300 Hz"
+	help
+	 Select 300 Hz to strike a balance between server performance and interactive
+	 responsiveness. This choice works well on SMP and NUMA systems and offers
+	 improved interactivity compared to lower frequencies. It is suitable for
+	 various workloads, including multimedia applications that require smoother
+	 interactive experiences. Examples include media streaming servers or video
+	 conferencing platforms.
+
+	config HZ_500
+		bool "500 Hz"
+	help
+	 Select 500 Hz for a balanced timer frequency that prioritizes both responsiveness
+	 and energy efficiency. It provides fast interactivity on desktop systems without
+	 significantly increasing power consumption or sacrificing battery life on laptops.
+	 This choice is suitable for general-purpose computing scenarios where quick
+	 user feedback is desirable. Examples include personal computers or laptops used
+	 for web browsing, document editing, and general multitasking.
+
+	config HZ_600
+		bool "600 Hz"
+	help
+	 Select 600 Hz for a balanced timer frequency that maintains fast interactivity
+	 on desktop systems. It offers a slight boost in responsiveness compared to lower
+	 frequencies without substantially increasing power consumption or sacrificing
+	 battery life on laptops. This choice is suitable for a wide range of computing
+	 tasks, including interactive applications and multitasking scenarios. Examples
+	 include gaming systems, graphical design workstations, or software development
+	 environments.
+
+	config HZ_750
+		bool "750 Hz"
+	help
+	 Select 750 Hz for a balanced timer frequency that ensures fast interactivity
+	 on desktop systems. It provides improved responsiveness compared to lower
+	 frequencies without substantially increasing power consumption or sacrificing
+	 battery life on laptops. This choice is suitable for interactive workloads
+	 and applications that require quick user feedback, such as gaming or real-time
+	 simulations. Examples include real-time strategy games or virtual reality
+	 applications.
+
+	config HZ_833
+		bool "833 Hz"
 	help
-	 300 Hz is a good compromise choice allowing server performance
-	 while also showing good interactive responsiveness even
-	 on SMP and NUMA systems and exactly dividing by both PAL and
-	 NTSC frame rates for video and multimedia work.
+	 Select 833 Hz as an alternative to 1000 Hz. This choice offers a balance between
+	 latency and performance, providing a slightly lower interrupt frequency that
+	 reduces interrupt overhead and improves system stability. It maintains satisfactory
+	 interactive responsiveness and is suitable for various applications where a
+	 lower interrupt frequency is desired without sacrificing overall system
+	 performance. Examples include audio workstations or video editing systems that
+	 require precise timing while minimizing system overhead.
 
 	config HZ_1000
-		bool "1000 HZ"
+		bool "1000 Hz"
+	help
+	 Select 1000 Hz as the preferred choice for desktop systems and other scenarios
+	 requiring rapid interactive responses. This high frequency ensures excellent
+	 interactive responsiveness and is suitable for applications that require quick
+	 user feedback and real-time interaction, such as graphical applications,
+	 user interfaces, or latency-sensitive tasks. Examples include graphical design
+	 workstations, real-time monitoring systems, or gaming platforms. However, it
+	 may result in increased interrupt overhead and slightly higher power consumption.
+
+	config HZ_1666
+		bool "1666 Hz"
+	help
+	 Select 1666 Hz for systems with low latency requirements. This choice prioritizes
+	 low latency over overall throughput and performance. It offers a snappier feel
+	 in response to interactive processes and is suitable for real-time systems,
+	 latency-sensitive workloads, and applications that demand quick response times,
+	 such as real-time audio or video processing. Examples include audio production
+	 systems, video streaming platforms, or real-time control systems. However, it
+	 may result in increased power consumption and slightly reduced overall system
+	 throughput.
+
+	config HZ_2000
+		bool "2000 Hz"
+	help
+	 Select 2000 Hz for demanding scenarios that require extremely fast timer interrupt
+	 responses. This choice offers exceptional interactive responsiveness and is ideal
+	 for ultra-low latency and real-time applications where precise timing is crucial,
+	 such as high-frequency trading or control systems. Examples include financial
+	 trading platforms or robotics control systems. However, it significantly increases
+	 interrupt overhead, power consumption, system load, and may negatively impact overall
+	 system stability.
+
+	config HZ_5000
+		bool "5000 Hz"
+	help
+	 Select 5000 Hz for specialized systems with stringent real-time requirements.
+	 This choice provides ultra-fast and precise timer interrupt responses, making it
+	 suitable for time-critical applications that require sub-millisecond accuracy,
+	 such as scientific simulations or robotics control. Examples include real-time
+	 simulations, scientific research platforms, or industrial automation systems.
+	 However, it significantly increases interrupt overhead, power consumption, system load,
+	 and may negatively impact overall system stability.
+
+	config HZ_10000
+		bool "10000 Hz"
 	help
-	 1000 Hz is the preferred choice for desktop systems and other
-	 systems requiring fast interactive responses to events.
+	 Select 10000 Hz for extremely high-frequency scenarios that demand ultra-fast and
+	 precise timer interrupt responses. This choice offers exceptional responsiveness
+	 and sub-microsecond accuracy, making it ideal for critical real-time applications,
+	 such as aerospace systems or medical equipment control. Examples include avionics
+	 systems, medical imaging platforms, or high-performance scientific computing.
+	 However, it significantly increases interrupt overhead, power consumption, system load,
+	 and may negatively affect overall system stability. Use with caution.
